Binary Tree:--

    Binary tree are DS which has two nodes (right and left) which points to other nodes and so on .
    We can use recaursion or stacking or Queueing or threading to traverse or insert elements to the tree.
 * Types of binary tree:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1)
    2)

 * Tree Traversal algorithim
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
BFS:
level order traversal

DFS:
inoreder traversal
preorder traversal
postorder traversal 
inverse a binary tree
-----------
DFS and BFS  for graphs
