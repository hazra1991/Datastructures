Binary tree are DS which has two nodes (right and left) which points to other nodes and so on .

We can use recaursion or stacking or Queueing or threading to traverse or insert elements to the tree.

BFS:
level order traversal

DFS:
inoreder traversal
preorder traversal
postorder traversal 
inverse a binary tree
-----------
DFS and BFS  for graphs

BST
